Hidden Markov models is a statistical signal prediction model for sequential data, which has been widely used to predict economic regimes and stock prices. 
In this work, we introduce the application of different versions of Hidden Markov Models in cryptocurrency trading based on the market state predictions. 
We first introduce the basic concepts of Hidden Markov Models and the Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter estimation along with 
the Viterbi algorithm for state prediction. We consider several models with different assumptions on the distribution of the observations, 
including the Gaussian HMM, Context-Sensitive HMM and other variants. Having trained the models on historical data, we then apply the models 
to predict the market states of the cryptocurrency market and use these predictions alongside predefined trading strategies to trade on the Binance spot market.
Lastly, we evaluate the performance of the models and trading strategies using the Sharpe ratio and MSE and compare the results with the benchmark strategy of buy-and-hold.
