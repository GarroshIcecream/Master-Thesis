 abstract = {The use of hidden Markov models for speech recognition has become predominant in the last several years, as evidenced by the number of published papers and talks at major speech conferences. The reasons this method has become so popular are the inherent statistical (mathematically precise) framework; the ease and availability of training algorithms for estimating the parameters of the models from finite training sets of speech data; the flexibility of the resulting recognition system in which one can easily change the size, type, or architecture of the models to suit particular words, sounds, and so forth; and the ease of implementation of the overall recognition system. In this expository article, we address the role of statistical methods in this powerful technology as applied to speech recognition and discuss a range of theoretical and practical issues that are as yet unsolved in terms of their importance and their effect on performance for different system implementations.},

	abstract = {Simulation techniques consist in sampling the input and characterizing the uncertainty of the corresponding output. This is notably the case of the crude Monte Carlo method that is well suited to characterize events whose associated probabilities are not too low with respect to the simulation budget. However, for very seldom observed events, this approach does not lead to accurate results. In this chapter, we review different simulation techniques such as importance sampling or adaptive splitting that estimate rare event probabilities with a low variance and a reduced number of samples. These methods seek to generate more samples of X so that ϕ(X) > T.},
