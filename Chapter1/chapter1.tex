As described in \cite{Ross2014}, a Markov chain is a stochastic process describing a sequence of possible events where the probability of each event depends solely on the state attained in the previous event. This is termed as the 'Markov Property', which encapsulates the memorylessness of the process â€” the future is independent of the past given the present.

Markov chains provide a robust framework for modeling the probabilistic nature of cryptocurrency markets. The rapid fluctuation of cryptocurrency prices, driven by a myriad of factors such as market sentiment, technological advancements, regulatory news, and macroeconomic trends, may be represented effectively using Markov chains. \cite{Zhang2023}

In this chapter, we start by laying down the fundamental theoretical foundations of Markov chains. This includes an explanation of key concepts such as state spaces, transition probabilities, and the difference between discrete and continuous time Markov chains. Understanding these basic building blocks is pivotal in leveraging Markov chains for cryptocurrency market analysis and trading.

Next, we focus on specific properties of Markov chains like irreducibility, periodicity, and stationarity, which play critical roles in determining the long-term behavior of the chain.

\section{Discrete-time Markov Chains}

Since we know that Markov Chain is a stochastic process, we ought to define what a stochastic process is, in itself, first. 

Let $\Omega \neq \emptyset$ and $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{\Omega}$ be a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$, and $\mathbb{P}$ a measure with $\mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1$, i.e. $\mathbb{P}$ is a \textit{probability measure}. According to \cite{Dostal}, the triplet $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ is, in this case, called a \textit{discrete probability space}. Where $\Omega$ denotes a sure event, and it holds that $\forall \omega \in \Omega$ is called an \textit{elementary event}. Furthermore, $\forall A \in \mathcal{F}$ is a random event  so that $\mathbb{P}(A)$ denotes a probability of that event. 

Let $I$ be a countable set and $\mathbb{S}$ a $\sigma$-algebra on $I$. Each $i \in I$ is called a \textit{state} and $(I,\mathbb{S})$ a \textit{state-space}.
Therefore, we have two measurable topological spaces $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$ and $(I,\mathbb{S})$ and a random variable $X: \Omega \rightarrow I$ assuming that X is measurable function. Thus, we call $(I,\mathbb{S})$ a state space and $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ an underlying space. Therefore, we may set:

\begin{equation}
\mu_X(i) = \mathbb{P}(X=i)=\mathbb{P}(\{\omega: X(\omega)=i\})
\end{equation}

Since we are allowing only for the discrete realizations of the random variable X, given previous assumptions and that $\sum\limits_{i \in I} \mu_X(i)=1$, $\mu_X$ is a \textit{probability mass function}. \cite{Norris2012}

Let us now assume that we have a sequence of random variables $\{X_t : t \in T\}$ where $T$ is a countable set of time steps.
 We say that $\{X_t : t \in T\}$ is a \textit{stochastic process} and if it also holds that $T = \mathbb{N}_0$ then {\it discrete-time stochastic process}.
 In the context of Markov Chains we call measurable space $I$ as a \textit{state space} and $X_t$ as a \textit{state} at time $t$ respectively.
 Given the initial setup, we may define a \textit{discrete-time Markov Chain} as a stochastic process $\{X_t : t \in T\}$ with a state space $I$ and a distribution $\mu_X$ such that for all $t \in T$ and $i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_{t+1} \in I$ it holds that:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:DTMC}
\mathbb{P}(X_{t+1}=i_{t+1}|X_t=i_t,\ldots,X_0=i_0) = \mathbb{P}(X_{t+1}=i_{t+1}|X_t=i_t)
\end{equation}

which holds for all $t \in T$ and $i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_{t+1} \in I$. \cite{Praskova2012} In other words, the probability of observing a state $i_{t+1}$ at time $t+1$ given the sequence of states $i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_{t+1}$ is equal to the probability of observing a state $i_{t+1}$ at time $t+1$ given only the last observed state $i_t$.
This fundamental relationship is called {\it Markov property}, and it is a consequence of the \textit{memoryless property} of Markov Chains. \cite{Haggstrom2002}
Conditional property of Markov Chains may be equivalently expressed using current state as $i \in I$ and a previous state $j \in I$ as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(X_{t+1}=i|X_t=j) = p_{j,i}(t,t+1)
\end{equation}

where $p_{j,i}(t,t+1)$ is a {\it transition probability} from state $j$ to state $i$ at time $t$ and $t+1$ respectively. Sometimes we refer to these transitions as {\it one-step transitions} since they are only dependent on the previous state.
As an extension of the Markov property we may also define a \textit{k-step transition} as a probability of observing a state $i$ at time $t+k$ given the state $j$ at time $t$ as \cite{Tolver2016}:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(X_{t+k}=i|X_t=j) = p_{j,i}(t,t+k)
\end{equation}

One important distinction by \cite{Weinan2019} is that if the transition probabilities $p_{j,i}(t,t+k)$ do not depend on time $t$ then the Markov Chain is called \textit{homogeneous} otherwise these probabilities vary over time, therefore \textit{heterogeneous} Markov Chain\footnote{In some sources the homogeneity with respect to time is emphasized s.t. the term is time-homogeneous or time-heterogenuous Markov Chains}.
Considering only first order homogeneous Markov Chain we may define a \textit{transition matrix} 
$A = (p_{i,j} : i,j \in I)$ as a matrix of transition probabilities between each state $i,j \in I$ such that:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1.5}
p_{j,i} \geq 0 \quad i,j \in I; \quad \sum\limits_{j \in I} ^{}p_{i,j} = 1, \quad \forall i \in I
\end{equation}

Rectangular matrix $\textbf{A}$ that satisfies property given by Equation \ref{eq:1.5} is called \textit{stochastic matrix}. \cite{Gagniuc2017}
Furthermore, we ought to define a probability distribution $\textbf{p} =\{p_i, i \in I\} $ as a vector of probabilities of observing each state at time $t=0$ such that:

\begin{equation}
p_i = \mathbb{P}(X_0=i), \quad i \in I
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
p_i \geq 0 \quad i \in I; \quad \sum\limits_{i \in I} ^{}p_i = 1
\end{equation}

which is also called \textit{initial distribution} of Markov Chain.

According to~\cite{Praskova2012}, once we have transition matrix $A$ and initial distribution $\textbf{p}$ that satisfy constraints given by Equation (1.5) and (1.7) respectively,
then $\{X_t,t \in \mathbb{N}_0\}$ is a discrete-time homogeneous Markov Chain with transition matrix $A$ and initial distribution $\textbf{p}$ 
if and only if all finite dimensional distributions of $\{X_t,t \in \mathbb{N}_0\}$ are consistent with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(X_{0}=i_0,X_{1}=i_1,\ldots,X_{k}=i_k) = p_{i_0} p_{i_0,i_1} \ldots p_{i_{k-1},i_k}
\end{equation}

where $i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_k \in I$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$. If we abstract from the initial distribution $p$, such equation is called \textit{Chapman-Kolmogorov equation} as in~\cite{Yin2004}.
Above stated equation also holds for non-homogeneous Markov Chains with the only difference that the transition probabilities $p_{i,j}$ are time dependent:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(X_{0}=i_0,X_{1}=i_1,\ldots,X_{k}=i_k) = p_{i_0}(0) p_{i_0,i_1}(0,1) \ldots p_{i_{k-1},i_k}(k-1,k)
\end{equation}

another substantial property of homogeneous Markov Chains is that their n-th order transition probabilities can be expressed as a product of their first order transition probabilities:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(X_{m+n} = j|X_{m} = i) = p_{i,j}^{(n)}, \quad i,j \in I
\end{equation}

where generally $p_{i,j}^{(m+n)} = \sum\limits_{k \in I} p_{i,k}^{(m)} p_{k,j}^{(n)}$ is referred to as \textit{Chapman-Kolmogorov equality} and holds for $m,n \in \mathbb{N}_0$ and $P(X_m=i) \geq 0$. \cite{Praskova2012}

To simply illustrate the idea behind discrete-time homogeneous Markov Chains let us assume a situation where the future market movements transition between a countable number of states $I =$ \{upward, side, downward\} 
and there is a transition matrix A and initial distribution $p$:

\begin{equation}
    \textbf{A} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0.1 & 0.4 & 0.5 \\
0.25 & 0.3 & 0.45 \\
0.33 & 0.33 & 0.33 
\end{pmatrix} 
, \quad \textbf{p} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
    0.2 & 0.3 & 0.5 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

using a maximum likelihood estimator of transition matrix according to \cite{Gagniuc2017}:

\begin{equation}
\hat{p}_{i,j} = \frac{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n-1} \mathbbm{1}_{\{X_k=i,X_{k+1}=j\}}}{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n-1} \mathbbm{1}_{\{X_k=i\}}}
\end{equation}

Each row represents full set of transition probabilities between states, also visible from $\sum\limits_{j \in I} ^{}p_{i,j} = 1 $, i.e. each row of matrix $\textbf{A}$ represents a conditional probability distribution given $i \in I$. 
Such a relationship can be represented as a diagram indexing each state by U, S and D respectively as follows:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->, >=stealth', auto, semithick, node distance=3cm]
\tikzstyle{every state}=[fill=white,draw=black,thick,text=black,scale=1]
\node[state]    (U)               {$U$};
\node[state]    (S)[right of=U]   {$S$};
\node[state]    (D)[right of=S]   {$D$};

    edge[bend left,above]       node{$0.4$}   (S)
    edge[bend right=55,below]   node{$0.5$}   (D)
(S) edge[bend left,above]       node{$0.45$}  (D)

    edge[loop right]            node{$0.33$}  (D)
    edge[bend left, below]      node{$0.33$}  (S);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Transition diagram of the Markov Chain given probabilities in matrix A.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This may be easily interpreted for each given state. For example if we assume that the market moved upwards on the last trading day there is a 0.1 chance that the market will move in positive direction today, in other words the conditional probability of observing the state U today given the state U yesterday is 0.1. 
On the hand if we suppose that today the market actually transitioned to the state S with probability 0.4 there is now a probability of 0.45 to transition to state D since the future transition is only conditioned by its previous state. 

Suppose now that we have observed a given sequence of states for the last week as $\{U,S,D,D,U\}$, and we would like to know the sequence joint probability given the transition matrix $\textbf{A}$ and initial distribution $\textbf{p}$:

\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(X_{t_0} = x_0,\ldots,X_{t_n} = x_n|A,p) &= \mathbb{P}(X_0 = x_0) \prod_{k=1}^4 \mathbb{P}(X_k=x_k|X_{k-1}=x_{k-1})\\
&= p_{x_0} p_{1,2} Â p_{2,3} Â p_{3,3} p_{3,1} \notag\\
&= 0.2 * 0.4 * 0.45 *Â 0.33 * 0.33 \notag\\
&= 0.002376 \notag
\end{align}

Where the probability of observing state $x_0$ is determined by our initial distribution $\textbf{p}$ since we have no prior knowledge about what exactly happened before $t_0$. 

On the other hand, we might consider a situation in which we have observed such a sequence of events, and we need to determine the next state given the sequence. As in the last example, we have our transition matrix $\textbf{A}$ and a sequence of events $\{U,S,D,D,U\}$ observed until $t_k$. Let us also assume that $t_{k+1}$ is a time of next event for which we are trying to determine its probability.

\begin{align}
    \mathbb{P}(X_{t_{k+1}}|X_{t_{k}},\ldots,X_{t_{k-4}}) &= \mathbb{P}(X_{t_{k+1}}|X_{t_{k}})
\end{align}

We know that last observed state was $U$ which directs us straight to the first row of our transition matrix A since from the properties of Markov Chains we know that the next state will depend solely on the present state, 
so we can abstract from the given sequence of past states and focus only on $X_{t_{k}}$. Finally, we may conclude that the most likely future state at time $t_{k+1}$ is $D$ with the probability of 0.5. Formally we may write:

\begin{equation}
 i_{k+1} = \underset{i \in I}{\arg\max} P(X_{t_{k+1}}=i_{k+1}|X_{t_{k}}=i_{k}) \\
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Classification of states}

Markov Chains may be classified into several categories based on their properties. 
Firstly, \cite{Praskova2012} and others, distinguish between \textit{transient} and \textit{recurrent} states and as a convenient notation we will introduce so-called \textit{return time} $\tau_j$ 
as a random variable that denotes the time of k-th return to state $j \in I$:

\begin{equation}
\tau_j(k+1) = \inf \{n \geq \tau_j(k) : X_n =j\}, \quad k \in \mathbb{N}_0
\end{equation}

if $\tau_j(k) \leq \infty$ and we assume that $\inf\{\emptyset\} = \infty$ and $\tau_j(0) = 0$.

This random variable also satisfies properties of {\it recurrence time}. 
Any random variable $\tau:\Omega \to \mathbb{N}_0 \cup \{ \infty \}$ for which outcomes $[\tau = n]$ belong to 
$\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(X_0,\ldots,X_n)$ generated by random variables $X_0,X_1, \ldots , X_n$ is called a {\it recurrence time}.

Thus, \cite{Bremaud1999} and \cite{Tolver2016}, state that $j \in I$ is \textit{transient} if there is a non-zero probability that the process will never return to state $j$ once it has left it, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(\tau_j(1) = \infty|X_0=j) > 0, \quad \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} p_{j,j}^{(n)} \leq \infty
\end{equation}

for some $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$. On the other hand, a state $j \in I$ is called {\it recurrent} if it is not transient, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(\tau_j(1) \leq \infty|X_0=j) = 1, \quad \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} p_{j,j}^{(n)} = \infty
\end{equation}

We can further distinguish between {\it positive recurrent} if the expected return time is finite $E[\tau_j(1)|X_0=j] < \infty$ and {\it null recurrent} if the expected return time is infinite $E[\tau_j(1)|X_0=j] = \infty$.

Let us make one more distinction regarding a Markov chain states as \cite{Gebali2008}. The greatest common divisor of the number of times a state can return to itself is the period. If the period is larger than 1, the state is called \textit{periodic} and 
on the contrary, if there is no such integer and the state can be revisited at any time, then the state is called \textit{aperiodic}.
If all states in a Markov chain are aperiodic, the Markov chain itself is said to be aperiodic as well. Aperiodicity is a desirable property for a Markov chain because it ensures that the chain does not get trapped in oscillating sequences of states. 
To clarify, a periodicity does not mean that each state must be reachable from every other state in just one step. It's a more subtle concept, meaning that the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all cycles in the chain must be 1, so that any state can be reached from any other state in a variable number of steps.

Previous properties of states lead us to define \textit{ergodic} state for which it holds that it needs to be positive, recurrent and aperiodic. Such trait is substantial since it implies that the state will be visited infinitely often and the expected time between visits is finite.
Same logic applies that if all states of a Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain itself is ergodic and thus irreducible, i.e. all states communicate with each other.

\subsection{Stationary distribution}

A pivotal concept linked to Markov Chains is that of the stationary distribution, a distinct probability 
distribution that remains invariant under the transition dynamics of the chain. 
If we denote $\pi = \{\pi_j,j \in I\}$ as a probability distribution, and it satisfies following equality by \cite{Bremaud1999}:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:stationary}
    \pi_j = \sum_{i \in I} \pi_i p_{i,j}, \quad j \in I
\end{equation}

then $\pi$ is called a \textit{stationary distribution} of Markov Chain. That also implies that if the initial distribution of homogeneous Markov Chain is stationary in the sense of Equation \ref{eq:stationary}
then Markov Chain is called strictly stationary stochastic process since the joint distribution of any finite number of random variables is invariant under the transition dynamics of the chain.
More specifically, for any $n,k \in \mathbb{N}_0$ and $i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_n \in I$ it holds that:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(X_0=i_0,X_1=i_1,\ldots,X_n=i_n) = \mathbb{P}(X_k=i_0,X_{k+1}=i_1,\ldots,X_{k+n}=i_n)
\end{equation}

and also for $\pi_j$ called initial stationary probabilities:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:init_stationary}
    p_j(n) = \mathbb{P}(X_n = j) = \pi_j, \quad j \in I
\end{equation}

It's important to stress that the existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution 
is not guaranteed for all Markov Chains, but under specific conditions a unique stationary 
distribution does exist and any initial distribution converges to this stationary distribution \cite{Praskova2012} as time progresses.
If all states of the chain are transient or null recurrent, then no stationary distribution exists. On the other hand if the chain is
positive recurrent, then a stationary distribution exists and is unique.

Important property of stationary distribution is that if we have an irreducible and aperiodic Markov Chain, its transition matrix $A$ converges to limiting matrix $\pi_{ij}$ according to \cite{Haggstrom2002} as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \lim_{n \to \infty} p_{ij}^{(n)} = \pi_{ij}, \quad i,j \in I
\end{equation}

since the transition matrix is irreducible, each row entry of limiting matrix $\pi_{ij}$ is equal to the stationary distribution $\pi_j$. This is called \textit{Markov Chain convergence theorem}, and it implies that if we run 
Markov Chain for sufficiently long time, the distribution at time n approaches the stationary distribution $\pi$, i.e. approaches equilibrium as $n \to \infty$.
 
The fundamental significance of the stationary distribution arises from its ability to dictate the long-term, 
steady-state behavior of the chain. Furthermore, the stationary distribution plays an essential role in the 
calculation of expected return times, the analysis of limiting probabilities, and \cite{Navarro2011} states that it forms the backbone of
algorithms such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm widely used in Monte Carlo simulations.

\subsection{Cryptocurrency market movements I.}

The probabilities in previously introduced transition matrix A were imaginary and served only as a mere example of the main properties of homogeneous discrete-time Markov Chains. 
For now consider a dataset of BTC-USDT daily close prices from public cryptocurrency exchange Binance website from 23rd August 2020 to 15th May 2023. 
Firstly, we ought to make several assumptions about the data in order to satisfy properties of Markov Chains, namely define finite state space, transition period and memoryless process. 

\begin{itemize}
\item [1)] \textbf{Transition period}: We will define a transition period as a day, i.e.\ the transition probabilities will be calculated for each day.
\item [2)] \textbf{State space}: We will define a state space as a set of 3 states \{upward, side, downward\} which will be determined by the percentage change of the close price of the current day with respect to the previous day as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [a)] \textbf{Upward}: If the percentage change of the close price of the current day with respect to the previous day is greater than 0.5\%.
    \item [b)] \textbf{Side}: If the percentage change of the close price of the current day with respect to the previous day is between -0.5\% and 0.5\%.
    \item [c)] \textbf{Downward}: If the percentage change of the close price of the current day with respect to the previous day is less than -0.5\%.
    \end{itemize}
\item [3)] \textbf{Memoryless process}: We will assume that the future state of the market only depends on the current state, i.e. the transition probabilities are independent of time.
\end{itemize}

Given these assumptions we first examine BTC-USDT close price time series data in \ref{fig:BTC-USD} and the distribution of the percentage change of the close price of the current day with respect to the previous day as shown in Figure \ref{fig:BTC-USD-distribution}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figs/BTC-USD.png}
        \caption{BTC-USD daily close prices from 23rd August 2020 to 15th May 2023 obtained from Binance. \cite{tradingview}}
        \label{fig:BTC-USD}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figs/BTC-USD_hist.png}
        \caption{Distribution of the log returns with respect to predefined market states. \cite{tradingview}}
        \label{fig:BTC-USD-distribution}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Observing the distribution of the log-returns of the daily BTC-USDT close price in \ref{fig:BTC-USD-distribution} we may conclude that such a random variable is normally distributed,
given the symmetric property of the distribution with respect to the mean value. Furthermore, it is visible that the kurtosis might be greater than 3,
which implies that the distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution, i.e. the extreme events are more likely to occur than in the normal distribution.
Such a property is also called \textit{leptokurtic} distribution which is a result of the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market. \cite{Peters1994}

Let us now take the ordered sample of states from the BTC-USDT close price time series data and calculate 
the transition and initial probabilities for each state as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \textbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
     0.22 & 0.16 & 0.62 \\
     0.32 & 0.27 & 0.41 \\
     0.6 & 0.19 & 0.21 \\
     \end{pmatrix}
     , \quad 
     \textbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix}
     0.4 & 0.19 & 0.41 \\
     \end{pmatrix}
 \end{equation}

where we note that the frequency of observing each state is proportional to the initial distribution $\textbf{p}$, and we assume that state space is $I = \{U,S,D\}$ 
By the definition of the transition matrix $\textbf{A}$, such matrix is also a stochastic matrix since it satisfies the properties given by Equation (1.5).
Each state of the transition matrix $\textbf{A}$ is also non-absorbing since the probability of observing a state $i$ at time $t+1$ given the state $j$ at time $t$ is greater than 0 
and aperiodic since the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all cycles in the chain is 1. Positive recurrence of each state is satisfied as well.
Furthermore, we may also conclude that the state space is irreducible since all states communicate with each other, i.e. there is a non-zero probability of transitioning from any state to any other state.
Therefore, we may conclude that the Markov Chain is ergodic, and the stationary distribution exists, is unique and is approximated by the initial distribution $\textbf{p}$ using Equation \ref{eq:stationary}.
Finally, we may also calculate the expected return time for each state as follows:

\begin{align}
    E[\tau_U(1)|X_0=U] &= \frac{1}{\pi_U} = \frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5 \\
    E[\tau_S(1)|X_0=S] &= \frac{1}{\pi_S} = \frac{1}{0.19} = 5.26 \\
    E[\tau_D(1)|X_0=D] &= \frac{1}{\pi_D} = \frac{1}{0.41} = 2.5
\end{align}

where $\pi$ is the stationary distribution of the Markov Chain. In other words, the expected time of returning to 
state $U$ and $D$ is 2.5 days, and 5.26 days for state $S$. Although, the expected return times provide interesting behavioral insights,
they are simplified by the Markov property of memoryless process, stock and cryptocurrency markets do have certain memory and path-dependence properties as well as they 
are effected by external factors such as news, social media, etc. Therefore, the expected return times are only approximations of the real expected return times.

\section{Continous-time Markov Chains} 

In the previous section we have considered a discrete-time Markov Chains, i.e.\ the state space and transition period was discrete. Such period means that 
the chain can stay in a state for integer number of time steps before transitioning to another state. 
For continous-time Markov Chains we will assume that the transition period is continuous, more specifically, the period is exponentially distributed with parameter $\lambda$.

Let us consider a stochastic process $\{X(t),t \geq 0\}$ on a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ s.t. for all $t \in \mathbb{R}_0^+$ and $i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_{t+1} \in I$ it holds that:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}(X(t)=j|X(s)=i, X_(t_n)=i_n,\ldots,X(t_1)=i_1) = \mathbb{P}(X(t)=j|X(s)=i)
\end{equation}

where $0 \leq t_1 < \ldots < t_n < s < t $ and so it is trivially seen that such expression is equivalent to the discrete-time Markov Chain property 
given by Equation~\ref{eq:DTMC} with the only difference of continuous transition period. \cite{Tolver2016}

Since the state space remains the same as in discrete-time Markov Chains, we refer to the same transition matrix $\textbf{A}$ and initial distribution $\textbf{p}$.
In upcoming subsection, continuous-time Markov Chain is assumed to be homogeneous, i.e.\ the transition probabilities are independent of time:

\begin{equation}
p_{i,j}(s,s+t) = p_{i,j}(t), \quad i,j \in I
\end{equation}

which also implies that the transition probability is determined only by the length of the transition period $t$. 
Chapmam-Kolmogorov equality for $s,t \geq 0$ also holds for continous-time Markov Chains:

\begin{equation}
p_{i,j}(s+t) = \sum\limits_{k \in I} p_{i,k}(s) p_{k,j}(t), \quad i,j \in I
\end{equation}

Here we also assume \cite{Gallager2013} stating following:

\begin{equation}
    \lim_{t \to 0_{+}} p_{i,j}(t) = \delta_{i,j} = 
        \begin{cases}
            1, & \text{if } i = j\\
            0, & \text{if } i \neq j
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\delta_{i,j}$ is a \textit{Kronecker delta function}, i.e. the transition probabilities $p_{ij}(t)$ are right continuous at $t=0$. \cite{Norris2012} says that if such additional conditions are satisfied for any homogeneous continous-time Markov Chain, 
then the underlying stochastic process is said to be continuous and there exists its version that is separable, measurable and its trajectories are cÃ dlÃ g almost surely. Such version allows us to infer 
certain properties of the stochastic process.

For example \cite{}, important property for such Markov Chain given \textit{Doob's martingale convergence theorem} for $s \geq 0$ and $h>0$ is:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(X(t) = i|X(s)=i, s \leq t \leq s+h) = \exp(-{q_i}h)
\end{equation}

which means that the probability of staying in state $i$ for time $h$ is equal to $e^{-{q_i}h}$. 
Non-negative real elements of $q_{i,j}$ are called \textit{transition rates} from state $i$ to state $j$ and absolute transition 
rate $q_i = \sum_{j \neq i} q_{i,j}$ respectively. Trivially, in cases where the transition rate $q_i=0$, the $p_{i,i} = 1$, i.e. the state $i$ is absorbing, 
once the chain enters such state it remains in such state for infinite amount of time. On the contrary, if $0 < q_i < \infty$ then the state $i$ is non-absorbing and stable, therefore
the chain will eventually leave such a state. For infinite transition rate $q_i = \infty$ the state $i$ is called {\it unstable} where the time of staying in such state is almost surely zero. \cite{Praskova2012}

If we consider a stable state $i$ then its expected time of staying in such state is exponentially 
distributed with expected value of $1/q_i$. In other words, the expected time of staying in state $i$ is equal 
to the inverse of the transition rate $q_i$. \cite{Norris2012}

Since, we have already defined that the process has exponentially distributed transition period, we may define a \textit{holding time} $T_i$ as a random variable that denotes the time of staying in state $i$:

\begin{equation}
T_i = \inf \{t \geq 0 : X(t) \neq i | X(0) = i\}
\end{equation}

from which it follows that $\mathbb{P}(T_i>s) = P(X_t=i,0 \leq t \leq s|X_0=i) = e^{-q_i s}$ and its probability density functions is:

\begin{equation}
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
        q_i e^{-q_i x}, & x \geq 0\\
        0, & \text{elsewhere}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

According to \cite{Praskova2012} and the properties of the transition rates, such time-homogeneous continuous Markov Chain should satisfy following equations:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbb{P}(X_{t+h}=i|X_t=i) &= 1 - q_i h + o(h) \\
        \mathbb{P}(X_{t+h}=j|X_t=i) &= q_{i,j} h + o(h), \quad i \neq j
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $o(h)$ is a function of $h$ such that $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{o(h)}{h} = 0$. Let us denote $\textbf{Q}$ as transition rates matrix with entries $\{q_{i,j}: i,j \in I\}$.

Such intensities resemble the probability functions of Poisson process, and indeed according to \cite{Norris2012} it is a special case of homogeneous continous-time Markov Chain with intensity $\lambda \geq 0$ if following conditions are satisfied:

\begin{itemize}
\item [1)] Stochastic process is viewed as a jump process, i.e.\ current state $i$ either stays in state $i$ or jumps to another state $j=i+1$. Therefore, given an interval $[t,t+h]$ the probability of jumping to another state is $\lambda h + o(h)$ and the probability of staying in state $i$ is $1-\lambda h + o(h)$.
\item [2)] Intensity $\lambda$ is constant, i.e.\ the probability of jumping to another state is independent of time, i.e. depends only on the length of the interval. We refer to such process as homogeneous Poisson process.
\item [3)] Number of jumps in disjoint intervals are independent, i.e.\ the probability of jumping to another state in disjoint intervals $[t_1,t_1+h]$ and $[t_2,t_2+h]$ is equal to the probability of jumping to another state in interval $[t_1,t_1+h] \cup [t_2,t_2+h]$.
\item [4)] The probability of more than one jump in a sufficiently small interval is negligible, i.e. the probability of jumping to another state in interval $[t,t+h]$ is $o(h)$.
\item [5)] Process starts in state $i=0$ at time $t=0$.
\end{itemize}

In a case of constant return rates, the matrix $\textbf{Q}$ with entries $q_{i} = - \lambda$ and $q_{i,j} = \lambda$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \textbf{Q} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    -\lambda & \lambda & 0 & 0 & \ldots \\
    0 & -\lambda & \lambda & 0 & \ldots \\
    0 & 0 & -\lambda & \lambda & \ldots \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
